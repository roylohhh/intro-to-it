    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Greetings, my name is Roy. I am an international student studying information technology in RMIT university. I enjoy watching videos on computer setups I cannot afford on the internet and anime in my free time. I work casually as a coffee barista at a hotel. As an international student in Melbourne, I find it quite challenging due to it being a new environment, however I am slowly getting used to the culture here. I aspire to work in the technology industry in the future.</p>

    <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
    <p>I believe IT is the future. Information technology is used in our daily lives and used by businesses to aid in creating, storing, and retrieving data and information. Technology is growing, evolving at an alarming rate, and it fascinates me how we went from using phones with buttons to basically a mobile computer, capable of calling, texting, surfing the internet, taking pictures, gaming and more. Even the gaming industry itself, back then I would be playing spider solitaire on the computer, just to kill time. Now, gaming itself can be a career. Gamers can stream on platforms like Twitch, and they are getting paid to have fun. During the pandemic, I noticed that information technology played a significant role in our lives. The use of new innovations and designs aided in combating covid. Existing IT solutions were utilised in tracking and ensuring the spread of covid as well. There was also an increase in online shopping, according to Forbes the U.S. online retail has generated over 1.7 trillion dollars in revenue over the last two years. Sometimes. I think information technology is frightening in a sense that occasionally when I am surfing the internet, there are advertisements recommending me products like the ones I have searched for before. Information Technology opens so many opportunities to the world, constantly moving forward with so much to learn and improve on, I want to be part of this growing industry.</p>

    <h3>Ideal job<h3>
    <p>Personally, I do not have a clear idea of what I want, as I still lack the knowledge and experience in this field of study. However, I do have interest in getting <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/56325414?type=standout#sol=32cbb8d2c687702ef13e1d69f4379f4c68d7e490" target='_blank'> a job in software development</a>, as I personally find this to be a very fulfilling career. Necessary skills in this career include programming, debugging and testing programs, problem solving skills, teamwork, and cloud knowledge. From my previous work experiences, I believe working in a group is important, however I would rather work in a smaller group to prevent disagreements. My ideal job would preferably require me to work not more than forty hours a week, and I hope to earn at least $100,000 minus tax. I hope to have a flexible job that allows me to work from home occasionally and only requires me to work at the office when necessary. Although being paid well is important, I would love to keep a certain level of my sanity, therefore I would like a job that would not stress me out, or a job that would not cause me to take my anger out on others.</p>

    <h4>Profile</h4>
    <img src="isfp-adventurer.png" alt="adventurer" height="250px">
    <p>Based on an online Myers-Briggs test (www.16personalities.com), I was assigned with the personality trait of an adventurer. An adventurer is a person with personality traits that are introverted, observant, feeling and prospecting. They live an eventful life; they are being inspired by people and ideas and are constantly reinventing and experimenting on themselves while trying to explore other perspectives. Surprisingly enough, adventurers are introverted, although they do love connecting with others, they will have to recharge their social battery occasionally after going out and meeting new people. Adventurers can often hit the sweet spot when complimenting a person, and they are also sensitive and compassionate to other people’s feelings, often relating to others and trying to minimise conflicts. However, adventurers themselves can lose their tempers when facing criticism, and are often caught up in the heat of the moment.</p>

    <img src="learningstyle.png" alt="learningstyle" height="250px">

    <p>According to my results using the learning styles quiz, my primary working style is pragmatist, meaning that I need a clear vision on how to apply what I have learnt into practice in the real world. Learning methods include practicals, problem setting, discussions and case studies. Pragmatists are constantly experimenting new theories and ideas to see if they work.</p>

    <h5>Project idea</h5>
    <p>My project idea is an AI shopping system. This can be used as a shopping assistant, helping the user find the best deals at affordable prices. The user logs in using a username and password, after logging in the user inputs desired product into the search engine, and the AI will perform a custom search across various products and categories throughout the internet, compare prices between similar products and output the cheapest and most reliable options. The AI will also have a feature that checks reliability of seller in terms of reviews in product quality and shipping time. The AI basically acts as a medium to search for the best possible deals throughout the internet through different websites without the user having to do it manually.</p>

    <p>In 2020, during the pandemic, there was a great shift to online shopping. People throughout the world would purchase products of websites like Amazon and Alibaba. Recently, I was looking to buy shoes of the internet. However, there were issues such as difficulty in finding an affordable price for the shoe, unreliable websites and fake shoes being sold online. Eventually I was able to find a good website to purchase my sneakers, however I had wasted an hour doing research, when I could have been doing this assignment instead.</p>

    <p>The AI will check seller’s data and previous selling history to ensure the links to these products are safe and authentic, to prevent user from being scammed. The AI will also check reviews to ensure seller is reliable (such as shipping and product quality). To ensure data security, the AI is only programmed to request and view certain data from both users and sellers, confidential information is hidden from those who are unauthorized. Encryption can be used to protect sensitive data and private information and can enhance communication security between servers and client applications. When checking out, the user will be redirected to a safe third-party website to ensure a smooth transaction.</p>

    <p>Common tools used would be GitHub for hosting the platform for control and collaboration, Google cloud platform for storing data, slack for business communication, NPM as a package manager for JavaScript (which will be used for coding in both front-end and back-end application) and Jira for tracking bugs. A variety of programming languages will be utilised; however, JavaScript and Python are the most common languages used. </p>

    <p>If this project succeeds, users will no longer have to waste time looking through multiple websites to second guess products or overpay for their goods. This can save users time and money and provide more confidence for online shoppers.</p>
